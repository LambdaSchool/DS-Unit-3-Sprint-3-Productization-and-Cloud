## What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I worked on debugging a colleague's code, unsuccessfully but we did manage to elliminate several possibilities, and then spent a very enjoyable hour with Audrey working on the problem of a user with no tweets being passed to our predict function, so we have a 0 dimensional numpy array being fed into our model.

Figuring out how to exclude users without tweets was an interesting software development question. Do we catch the error in the model? In the app? In the initial add_user function? The latter turned out to be the most prescient. 

## What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I'm surprised by how much I hated it yesterday compared with how ok I am with the topic today. I mean, I'm no expert but it no longer fills me with despair.

## What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Honestly, still putting the pieces together. This week was a little disjointed because JC was obviously working off of AG's original material, so I had to piece it together myself with help from PMs and colleagues. In the end it seems ok but I struggled a lot this week.
