## Questions

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I managed to be very productive today and caught up all the way to a successful deployment. 
A lot of things had to go well for that to happen, mostly having to do with debugging. 
I managed to get everything to work how I wanted it to, and even some things that exceeded my expectations. 
For example, getting the flash messages to work successfully, and to use the correct colors 
that I specified in my custom css theme. I also got the one class method to work (pretty well, at least) 
for both cases where the form is submittedâ€”the user is in the database, and the user is not.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Even though I deployed a plotly dash app (which is based on Flask) last unit, I am very surprised by 
how darn easy it is to deploy on Heroku. I guess there really is something to the whole PAAS thing. 
I was a little worried that adding the database to the app would make the deployment more difficult, 
as the dash app did not use a database. However, it was still very quick and easy.

I do still want to get good at setting up my own Linux servers and manually deploying apps to them. 
I feel like that is a skill that would be valuable for me to have, as I would like to be able to 
cheaply deploy my little side projects without worrying about the costs of PAAS.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

While the debugging ultimately went well for me today, it was also the most difficult part of the build. 
Not only did I have to figure out ways of fixing my code to get around errors, but because I wrote a lot 
of custom code that was not in the lecture repo, I had to manage my doubts about how I as solving the 
problems. There were many times when I thought about giving up on my custom code and build it exactly 
the same as Aleks did.

Glad I stuck it out and got it to work, however ugly and/or slow my code is. Doing that taught me a ton 
more than I would've if I'd stuck to the script.
