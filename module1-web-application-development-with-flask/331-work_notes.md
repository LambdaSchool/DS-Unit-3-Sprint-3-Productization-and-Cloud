## Questions

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I enjoy working with Flask immensely, though I've been working with Django more over the last 6 months or so. In particular I've been loving how powerful Flask is for smaller projectsâ€”I have so many ideas for little apps and am happy to be working with Flask along with the rest of the cohort.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I find web frameworks like Flask to be interesting in general, mostly to do with how easy it is to get a project started. However, as far as today goes, I found the idea of an app factory particularly interesting. I hadn't used that in a long time and had mostly forgotten about it.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

The most challenging part of the work today was actually getting my virtual environment set up and Pipenv to work correctly. I followed the lecture and decided, after I'd already generated a perfectly-fine virtual environment with `psycopg2-binary` installed, to try and build `psycopg2` from source. I went down a small rabbit hole trying to get that working, which ended up causing some other issues with other packages. Ultimately I had to nuke the entire environment and start from scratch.
