## What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

It was easy to follow along with the lecture content. I am surprised i didn't run into big errors. hahahaha. 

## What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
What was exciting was knowing how to build a simple application using flask. It's my first time using flask and it was exciting thinking about all the future possibilities. It was surprised and excited to build my own local database inside the command line using sqlite3.

## What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

The most challenging part is wrapping my head around how everything works together especially flask, database communicating with flask, and how the whole server, client, wep app, interactions work.
