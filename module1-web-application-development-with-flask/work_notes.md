- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I was able to reconstruct the lecture notes - build my flask app for "hello_world" and structure for "TwitOff".

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

There's a lot of devops concepts like flask, api's, and such to be able to get an understanding over. Additionally, it will be cool to  deploy DS skills over Twitter's API and showcase with Flask. 

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Understanding the devops concepts and following the TwitOff code. Hopefully, clarity will build over the next modules. Or else, I'll have to read up on Flask by myself later.
