DAY !

1) I learned a lot, as always, after some level of frustration, as always.  Im getting better at taking things apart, so thats good.  Just wish I could constuct equally as well :'D

2) I thought the most interesting part of this was the flash SQL replacement thingie, looking over it is pretty awesome.

3) The most challenging part was figuring out why my enviroment was giving me syntax errors until I ran the same code 3 times.  We never did figure it out but after an exit and restart it happened less often so hooray!
