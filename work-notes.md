DAY 1

1) I learned a lot, as always, after some level of frustration, as always.  Im getting better at taking things apart, so thats good.  Just wish I could constuct equally as well :'D

2) I thought the most interesting part of this was the flash SQL replacement thingie, looking over it is pretty awesome.

3) The most challenging part was figuring out why my enviroment was giving me syntax errors until I ran the same code 3 times.  We never did figure it out but after an exit and restart it happened less often so hooray!


DAY 2

1) Ive learned to make smaller commits and test them out.  Writing a whole file out of hand just to have a syntax error say its somewhere in these 3 files is kind of annoying, but anything is a lesson from a certain angle :D 

2)The most interesting part of this assignment was the raw output in the terminal of the predictions.  It really brought together what seemed like a very broad lecture and made the variables seem more sensible.

3) So far the most challenging part is chasing down this syntax error!  it cant be the "else:" so it must be in either the try: or the app.py that references it I think.  Ill get there!
