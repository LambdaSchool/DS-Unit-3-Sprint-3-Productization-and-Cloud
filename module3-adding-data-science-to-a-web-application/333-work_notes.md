## Questions

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I got my new `DeftTwit` class up and running in short order, and was able to structure it in such a way that it provided immediate benefit to the app and to me. Aside from that I also diverged / stretched from the app structure that Aleks is building, using the Flask extension of WTForms, `flask-wtf`, to build the forms on my app.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I was very interested in some deeper / more complex OOP topics, though did not spend as much time digging into that as I'd hoped. The `flask-wtf` method of setting up forms was also interesting, and allowed me to flex my OOP muscles a bit more.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

I fell behind and took my time to catch up, so the most challenging part was simply trying to get everything done on time. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to set up the predictions functionality as of yet.
