## Monday:

Todays assignment went well and I was able to replicate the lecture example pretty easily. The hardest part of the assignment was learning the new syntax associatd with flask and building a flask app for the first time. The most interesting part was how easy it is (using templates) to make a simple web app using flask. I like that you only have to add pages you need and the HTML seems relatively straight forward and easy to use when using a template.


## Tuesday:

The assignment today went well. I was able to pull tweets from the API and populate my database with them. I was also able to make a new column with the embeded tweet data using Basilica. The hardest part of the assignment was populating my flask page with the newly gathered information. It took me a couple different tries but eventually I was able to make it work.
