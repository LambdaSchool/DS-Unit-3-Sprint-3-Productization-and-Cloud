Day Uno:

- Learning sqlalchemy went well, setup the database and put a few choice words here and there.
- I was particularly happy about how simple it seems to setup a webserver with Flask that can also easily commune with an SQL database. That was quite cool.
- Challenging was trying to manually add in tweets and users and such. Investigating more would do the world some good I think.
