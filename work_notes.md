What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
starting to learn more about the underlying flask architecture. 
Not everything is connecting so working on reconnecting examples from lecture

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
it almost reminds me of working on a wordpress site or drupal. a way to organize things, good templates and pieces to use as a starting or jumping off point. 

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
reproducing the examples we saw in class in a working format.
