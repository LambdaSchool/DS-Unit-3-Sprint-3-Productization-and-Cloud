# Notes for my work on the Twitter predictions project

My project repo is [here](https://github.com/davidanagy/Twitoff-Project).

## Monday November 11

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Most everything went well today.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I'd already made a web app for my previous Build Week project, but I didn't really understand
the mechanics of how it worked (e.g. the "__init__" file, how to create pages, etc); I just
copied the template Ryan Herr made. So I enjoyed learning more about how that worked.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

I ran into some bugs while following the lecture; it seems that the process of getting Flask
to run is different on Windows and Mac, for example. So debugging in general was the hardest
part, but thanks to help from others in the cohort, it didn't take very long.

## Tuesday November 12

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Again, most everything went well. The only annoying thing is the VSCode bug that doesn't let it
recognize the methods in SQLAlchemy(). At some point I'll look into other text editors such as
Atom to see if I prefer them.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I was surprised that you can do for-loops inside HTML! I've done a little bit of HTML
in the past and had no idea.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Completing the stretch goal; it took me some time to figure out how to get the query
right, and how to set up the HTML so it did what I wanted it to do (e.g. with links).

## Wednesday November 13

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Once more, most everything went well. The assignment itself was basically completed
by following along in the lecture so I just spent time making it look nicer and adding
in some additional functionality.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Today really taught me the power of Flask routing--using variable assignments with if/then
statements to make is to that a single HTML template can give very different results
depending on the input.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

The HTML; I have little experience with HTML so it took some time to figure out how to do
what I wanted to do with it. I ended up learning about the Bootstrap stylesheet though,
which was very helpful!
