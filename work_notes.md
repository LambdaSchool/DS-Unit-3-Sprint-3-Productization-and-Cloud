## Module 1 - Web Application Development with Flask
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Overall, the assignment was pretty easy, but I'm interested to see how we can use the
HTML templates and front-end business to make our websites prettier.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
It's amazing how flexible Flask and SQLAlchemy are and I never imagined that we could
use SQLAlchemy to write OOP-based SQL structuring.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The work wasn't very challenging after following Alex Kim's lecture since he was able
to bring a lot of the topics from the lecture into a more holistic point-of-view
and explained a lot of what was going on as he progressed through the project.

## Module 2 - Consuming Data from an API
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

## Module 3 - Adding Data Science to a Web Application
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I didn't have to debug much aside from some very small problems, and following along
with the lecture was fairly straightforward.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
I think caching the models with Redis is something that can take the project from a
pet project to a more scalable project since it doesn't have to do the work of
generating the model for every comparison if the model has already been trained. I'm
interested in learning more about it and maybe implementing it into the project.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The most challenging part was writing the new routes and getting the data to display
on the page according to the route.
