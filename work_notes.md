Todays assignment went well and I was able to replicate the lecture example pretty easily. The hardest part of the assignment was learning the new syntax associatd with flask and building a flask app for the first time. The most interesting part was how easy it is (using templates) to make a simple web app using flask. I like that you only have to add pages you need and the HTML seems relatively straight forward and easy to use when using a template.
