*Module 1*

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Reproduced the steps from lecture: write and run a basic local Flask web application.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Ben Manning's thorough overview on deployment was very informative!

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Took time to find the correct Windows syntax from the command line.  
Another good exercise was getting my pipenv configuration in order and understanding why/how it works.

*Module 2*

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Following along with the lecture from Bruno Janota, managed to write methods to pull Users and Tweets.  
Including an embedding field in my Tweet model.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Interaction with both Twitter and Basilica API is quite smooth.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Had some troubles setting up my local/pipenv environment, SQLAlchemy in particular gace some headaches.  
Interaction between the module 1 lecture from Ben Manning and the prerecorded module 2 lecture from Bruno Janota was not seamless.
