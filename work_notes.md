# Day 1 - Web Application Development with Flask: 
Once you get the intuition of workflow, despite the huge amount of new information in short time, it is really fun. In the context of working on the assignment everything went well: the installation of packages was OK, I made a typo, so I just deleted the pipfile and I restarted the steps;  when running the flask app I got error because some typos in the .py files, really easy to find and fix.
