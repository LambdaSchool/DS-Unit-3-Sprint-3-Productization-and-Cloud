# Unit 3 Sprint 4 Work Notes <br>

## Day 1
[Link to project repo](https://github.com/connorpheraty/TwitOff) <br> <br>
What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- I was able to follow along with the lecture with minimal issues. I created a repo and created the TwitOff package. I created the app.py script which enables me to create and connect to a local sqlite database. I then created the models.py script where I created the schema for the sql database. <br>

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- I particularly enjoyed using knowledge from both the first and second week of this unit. I am really beginning to form a well grounded understanding of how websites interact with databases. <br>

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- Understanding the syntax of Flask. More specifically, understanding why and how the app.py script works. It is critical in data science to understand how databases work with web applications. I will continue to try to gain a more well rounded understanding of this interaction.
