# Work Notes for TwitOff App

## Monday, September 16, 2019
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Flask app is up and running. I created a module for loading data into the database.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Fitting all the pieces together and acutally getting them to work is nice.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Python syntax: why the dot with `from .app import create_app`?
Bash syntax: what is the colon in `FLASK_APP=twitoff:APP`?
The different build patterns available for packages in general and Flask apps in particular can be confusing.
I would like to know the correct way to get a module to load and run while within the flask shell.
