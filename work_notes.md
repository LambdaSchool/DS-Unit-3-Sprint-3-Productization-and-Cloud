# Notes for my work on the Twitter predictions project

My project repo is [here](https://github.com/davidanagy/Twitoff-Project).

## November 11

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Most everything went well today.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I'd already made a web app for my previous Build Week project, but I didn't really understand
the mechanics of how it worked (e.g. the "__init__" file, how to create pages, etc); I just
copied the template Ryan Herr made. So I enjoyed learning more about how that worked.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

I ran into some bugs while following the lecture; it seems that the process of getting Flask
to run is different on Windows and Mac, for example. So debugging in general was the hardest
part, but thanks to help from others in the cohort, it didn't take very long.

## November 12

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Again, most everything went well. The only annoying thing is the VSCode bug that doesn't let it
recognize the methods in SQLAlchemy(). At some point I'll look into other text editors such as
Atom to see if I prefer them.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I was surprised that you can do for-loops inside HTML! I've done a little bit of HTML
in the past and had no idea.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Completing the stretch goal; it took me some time to figure out how to get the query
right, and how to set up the HTML so it did what I wanted it to do (e.g. with links).
