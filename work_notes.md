# Day 1
What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

- Finished what was necessary and finished the work we would be doing on Tuesday.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

- SQLAlchemy makes life easy.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

- the .env file instantiated in the repo and how gitignores work. Not the most intuitive thing for me.
- I also think the .env thing was particularly annoying when I didn't have it in my gitignore.
- I am a naive melon.
