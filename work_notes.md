## Monday:

Todays assignment went well and I was able to replicate the lecture example pretty easily. The hardest part of the assignment was learning the new syntax associatd with flask and building a flask app for the first time. The most interesting part was how easy it is (using templates) to make a simple web app using flask. I like that you only have to add pages you need and the HTML seems relatively straight forward and easy to use when using a template.


## Tuesday:

The assignment today went well. I was able to pull tweets from the API and populate my database with them. I was also able to make a new column with the embeded tweet data using Basilica. The hardest part of the assignment was populating my flask page with the newly gathered information. It took me a couple different tries but eventually I was able to make it work.

## Wednesday

Everything went well today, I wasnt able to upload different data into my web app and use it to make predictions on, but I was able to finish the lecture task and predict who said what tweet between two users. I got hung up on two simple bugs. The first one being a couple typos I had made. The second being that I wrote "return app"
twice in my app.py resulting in an internal server error when I tried to flask run. Both errors forced me to go back through the lecture written code and review all of the days work. Overall I dont feel like the time was wasted since I learned a lot re-reviewing my code wrtitten during lecture in detail.
