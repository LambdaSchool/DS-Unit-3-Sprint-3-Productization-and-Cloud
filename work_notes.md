- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I was able to pretty easily follow along in the lecture. Had a small bug that I ran into, but I easily fixed it later.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I thought it was interesting how easy it was to connect flask to a database and create tables/insert data.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Just following along with all the different environments that Aaron was using that we didn't necessarily have to use (docker/vim/emacs).
