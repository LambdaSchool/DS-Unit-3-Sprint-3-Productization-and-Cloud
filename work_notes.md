## Monday, November 11, 2019:

- What went well: Just about everything, there was a little trouble import modules and some other strange bugs, but everything worked out alright in the end

- What was interesing: How we interacted with the database. Seemed more like noSQL but was not quite the same.

- What was the most challenging: There was nothing particuarly challenging. That being said, Aleks works very fast, and if you fall behind there are a lot of steps you will miss being able to complete during lecture and will have to go back and complete them on your own time watching the video
