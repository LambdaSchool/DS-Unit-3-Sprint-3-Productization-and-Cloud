**Monday**
- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I was able to follow along without any problems.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Learning about a web application actually is and how all the major parts fit together to make it work. It was especially informative to see how the database connects with everything else. Learning the terminology (e.g. front vs. back end was a conceptual leap).

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Trying to even understand what the stretch goals and topics mean.
