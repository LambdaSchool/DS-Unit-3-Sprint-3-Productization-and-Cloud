# 11/11/2019 (module 1)
1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- Creating the flask app, adding user and tweet classes, creating all the required files, working with flask in the command line, submitting request to work with the Twitter API. Basically, the whole assingment went well.
2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- Basilica looks interesting, though I haven't dug deeper than surface-level yet.
3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- Being okay with not understanding why we need every specific file for setting up the flask app and what each one does. It's challenging because a lot of the names for the modules and classes are similar. I might be getting terms mixed up.
