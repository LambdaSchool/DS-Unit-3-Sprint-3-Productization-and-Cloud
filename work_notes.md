Monday:

Q&A 1:
What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? 
Answer: After many interations, I was able to completely recreate the lecture, as well as simulate tweets from the Avengers as my "Users" along with their "Tweets".

Q&A 2:
What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? 
Answer: Once, I really focused on the lecture, it is suprisingly easy to follow along and grasp the topic. Creating users and tweets was the easist part. 

Q&A 3:
What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Answer: The most challenging part of today was when I missed a step and created directories for app.py and __init__.py by mistake. I had to basically start all over, which I didn't mind because it gave me more experience with this topic. Another particularly challenging part was trying to get pipenv to work on my desktop. For some reason, I was encountering an error so once I switched to my laptop it ran smoothly.
