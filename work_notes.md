Day Uno:

- Learning sqlalchemy went well, setup the database and put a few choice words here and there.
- I was particularly happy about how simple it seems to setup a webserver with Flask that can also easily commune with an SQL database. That was quite cool.
- Challenging was trying to manually add in tweets and users and such. Investigating more would do the world some good I think.

Day Dos:

- Nothing really went well which was a first in my Lambda experience.
- Very unecessarily hard day. Had a hell of a time trying to understand what exactly to do/ how exactly to proceed. 
I was insistent on trying to figure it out though and that attitude actually came around to bite me.
- Everything was challenging today, but not because the content is deep but because making anything on the web is literal
hell on Earth lmao.

Day Tres:

- I found Ryan Herr's notes, that's what went well. I went file by file trying to understand how the hell to build this thing
with Flask and Jinja/Jenga whatever. Crazy, it worked though!
- The craziest part of today was that the actual data science parts of the site were not that difficult, like, I assumed it would be the hardest but actually using Jinja/Jenja was the hardest by a country mile.
- Hardest part -> Jinjango, always and forever. I'd be very happy if I never had to use it again.
