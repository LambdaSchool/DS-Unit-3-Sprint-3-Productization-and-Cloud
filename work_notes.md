# Day 1: web app development with flask
- **what went well**

  - Got everything to run correctly (I think). I can populate database with new inputs.  I can connect the flask app to the server 
and get the hello world app to run. 

- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - It is pretty cool to experience how easy it can be to get a quick flask app up and running.  Pretty powerful.  

- **What was the most challenging part about the work today, and why?**

  - Understanding how the package works together is the difficult part for me.  Still not sure how flask makes it easy to connect to a server 
to run the app in the file.  It all still feels like magic to me.
