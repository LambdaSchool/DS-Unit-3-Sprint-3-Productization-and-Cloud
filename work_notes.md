# Notes for my work on the Twitter predictions project

My project repo is [here](https://github.com/davidanagy/Twitoff-Project).

## November 11

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Most everything went well today.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I'd already made a web app for my previous Build Week project, but I didn't really understand
the mechanics of how it worked (e.g. the "__init__" file, how to create pages, etc); I just
copied the template Ryan Herr made. So I enjoyed learning more about how that worked.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

I ran into some bugs while following the lecture; it seems that the process of getting Flask
to run is different on Windows and Mac, for example. So debugging in general was the hardest
part, but thanks to help from others in the cohort, it didn't take very long.
