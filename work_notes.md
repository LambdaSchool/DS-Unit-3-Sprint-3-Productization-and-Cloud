Q2) What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Q3) What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Day: module 1 
1) Took some time and troubleshotting but i was able to replicate the lecture and complete 
todays homework. 

2) The location of files in what folder is very important

3) The most challenging part for today was pipenv installing packages pycopg2 wouldnt install 
but i was able to find a work around. 

Day: module 2
1) Completed todays assignments with minimal troubleshotting.

2) It doesn't look like a lot of code, however the code is quite sufisticated.

3) There was a lot to take in that you couldn't dive in depth to why certain things are done. Need to accept thats just how its done.
