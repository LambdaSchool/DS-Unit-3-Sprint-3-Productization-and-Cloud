[Twitoff repo](https://github.com/srfinley/twitoff)

## Module one

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I managed to successfully follow along with today's lecture. Everything else fell naturally from that.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
This is an interesting addition of depth to the stuff that got kind of glossed over when I was building the Plotly Dash app last unit.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
psychopg caused problems for me and some of the rest of the cohort. The source of the problem was not explained and we were told to use an alternate version of the package without a clear sense of the tradeoffs that might be involved in a decision like that. This was frustrating.

## Module two

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
No conceptual issues. Had all the API access in place in advance.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Really liked the .env business. Definitely a cooler solution that my earlier ".py file the name of which is in the gitignore" fix.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Ran into a stupid bug fairly early on in the lecture that somewhat stymied my ability to follow along. Once it was settled, it appeared I hadn't messed up anything substantial when I was following blind. Bad focus during assignment time, in large part due to ambivalence about today's particular stretch goals.
