## Module one

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I managed to successfully follow along with today's lecture. Everything else fell naturally from that.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
This is an interesting addition of depth to the stuff that got kind of glossed over when I was building the Plotly Dash app last unit.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
psychopg caused problems for me and some of the rest of the cohort. The source of the problem was not explained and we were told to use an alternate version of the package without a clear sense of the tradeoffs that might be involved in a decision like that. This was frustrating.
