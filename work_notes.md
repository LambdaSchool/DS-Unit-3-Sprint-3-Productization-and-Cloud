Day 1:
**What went well:**
I created the model for Tweet and User. I added fake data to my local database

**What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today:**
It is a completely new topic, and I am excited to make this app more complex

**What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?**
The most challenging part was to follow the instructions, but I watched the recording from previous cohorts, and finally I understood what I have to do
