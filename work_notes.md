Monday

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? Getting everything working with Windows environment was a bit different than the lecture, but it went okay and had no problems with the assignment.  

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? I really like the accessibility of SQLAlchemy. I can see how you would automate DB creation, editing, etc with clearly defined classes. 
Much easier than writing a bunch of query modules. More efficient too.  

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? Just getting it working with Windows. Lots of little tweaks here and there.

Tuesday

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? It was pretty straightforward I thought, just a bunch of reading documentation.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? Mmmm, I really like the embeddings and the ease in gathering/storing tweet history.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? As usual, making it all work on Win10.
