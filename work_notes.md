### 6/17/19
1. **What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?**
<br> The assignment was very clear and doable. I enjoyed it very much.
2. **What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?**
<br> How the database connects to the site and seeing it happen. It was very rewarding to put stuff into the database that I made and have it stay there
3. **What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?**
<br> Following along with Aaron and then understanding what parts of the code do what things. I still don't understand that part.

### 6/19/19
1. **What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?**
<br> My app page finally works. YAY. I also feel like I'm understanding the code a lot better.
2. **What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?**
<br> The basilica embedding was interesting to think about. I'm glad Connor found a video of it.
3. **What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?**
<br> It was really hard to spot all the bugs in my code. It was also very frustrating when everything was right but it only worked after I restarted vscode.
