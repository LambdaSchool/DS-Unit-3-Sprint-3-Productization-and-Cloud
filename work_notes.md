## Module 1 - Web Application Development with Flask
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Overall, the assignment was pretty easy, but I'm interested to see how we can use the
HTML templates and front-end business to make our websites prettier.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
It's amazing how flexible Flask and SQLAlchemy are and I never imagined that we could
use SQLAlchemy to write OOP-based SQL structuring.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The work wasn't very challenging after following Alex Kim's lecture since he was able
to bring a lot of the topics from the lecture into a more holistic point-of-view
and explained a lot of what was going on as he progressed through the project.
