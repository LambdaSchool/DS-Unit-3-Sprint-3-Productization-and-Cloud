# Day 1: web app development with flask
- **what went well**

  - Got everything to run correctly (I think). I can populate database with new inputs.  I can connect the flask app to the server and get the hello world app to run. 

- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - It is pretty cool to experience how easy it can be to get a quick flask app up and running.  Pretty powerful.  

- **What was the most challenging part about the work today, and why?**

  - Understanding how the package works together is the difficult part for me.  Still not sure how flask makes it easy to connect to a server 
to run the app in the file.  It all still feels like magic to me. 

# Day 2: consuming data from an API
- **what went well**

  - Was able to connect to twitter and basilica API.  I fetched tweets from Austen and my own twitter account, which was pretty cool to see.  I also was able to embed the tweets and get them into the database.  I also added an user route and a link to it, which was tricky, but works for now.  Lastly I experimented with picnin css to make the pages look somewhat nicer.
  
- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - The fact that you can extract information from such a huge database like twitter is unbelievable to me.  Also what basilica does is pretty amazing as well.  We haven't built the model yet, but the fact that those embeddings will be able to tell how similar certain tweets are, is pretty cool.  I can see how useful something like that can be for many different types of applications.
  
- **what was the most challenging part about the work today, and why?**

  - Getting used to how the routes work was pretty tricky. I had to do a lot of searching on my own, to figure out how flask works.  Making the correct references was hard to intuitively figure out.  Eventually I got something to run though.
