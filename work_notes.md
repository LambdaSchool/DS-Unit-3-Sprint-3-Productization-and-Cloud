Monday 04/08
models.py and app.py communicate as intended, as do the Name and Tweet objects in models.
I have a database, but I didn't want to populate far beyond proof of concept because I imagine
it will get wiped tomorrow.

What went well:
I am gaining more patience with debugging. models.py had to be brought back up
and have one edit at a time for a while. The experience of having to constantly exit one doc
and shuffle between another inspired me to finally figure how to get vscode running on WSL,
which spent the rest of the day after completing the base goal.

What was interesting or suprising about today?:
Revisiting OOP and seeing how intricately different objects can communicate.

What was the most challenging part of the work today?:
I might sound like a broken record, but it was definitely just making
the objects connect properly with foriegn keys. Capitalization is key.

The VSCode install that required a remote host and emulating firefox so the download would go in the right place
was harder then the assignment. : )
