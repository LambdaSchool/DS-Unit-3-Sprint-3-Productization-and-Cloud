The breeder also claims that 24K Gold produces a strong tangerine scent and kush-flavored buds. 24K Gold won third Place at the Milano Secret Cup in 2018. ", "1": "303 OG Kush is a strain with various sources of origin. Below are several anecdotes about the strain's inception. \r\n\r\nOrigin #1\r\n303 OG, also called 303 Kush or 303 OG Kush, is reported to have first been cultivated in Colorado by the breeder known as Zombo and is an Indica-dominant cross between a Pre-'98 Bubba Kush and Reservoir ChemDawg IC3.\r\n\r\nReported by online sources to have been selected for its phenotypes by Colorado\u2019s Hill Billy, the strain was named after Denver\u2019s area code. Clones are the best option for cultivators looking to grow 303 OG, as seeds are not easily obtained.\r\n\r\nOrigin #2\r\nThe 303 OG grown by The Clinic in Colorado is an Indica-dominant cross between Kosher Kush and Ghost OG. Available throughout Colorado, flowers from The Clinic\u2019s 303 OG strain provides a sweet and spicy flavor profile that\u2019s popular for its OG characteristics, powerful body high, and cerebral effects.\r\n\r\nThe Clinic\u2019s 303 OG Nug Run Sugar Budder won first place in 2014 for Best U.S. Concentrates at the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup. The Clinic\u2019s 303 OG THC content has been tested as high as 20%, and the strain reportedly helps mitigate physical discomfort, apprehension, insomnia, and loss of appetite.\r\n", "2": "While the original breeder of 3 Kings is unknown, the lineage of this sativa-leaning hybrid is made up of Headband, Sour Diesel, and OG Kush, three strains often crowned as royalty by the cannabis community. Available from several online seed banks, 3 Kings reportedly carries a tangy and sour aroma and moderate THC levels of about 16%.\r\n\r\nThree Kings grows to a medium height, yielding moderate amounts of pale green colas glistening with frosty trichomes in an eight-to-nine-week flowering period. This strain is suitable for indoor or outdoor growing conditions, but is said to require some experience to properly manage.\r\n\r\nGrowers should expect 3 Kings seeds to harvest up to 600 grams per square meter indoors and up to 650 grams per plant outside. Some sources also suggest that certain samples of 3 Kings have tested for high levels of cannabichromene (CBC), a cannabinoid that has purported anti-inflammatory properties.", "3": "3X Crazy, also known as Insane OG or Optimus Prime, is a three-way cross of OG Kush, Bubba Kush, and Granddaddy Purple. This strain is said to carry an aroma of grapes and pepper with earthy undertones.\r\n\r\nInsane OG is the name Dr. Greenthumb, a Caifornia dispensary launched by Cypress Hill rapper B-Real, gave its version of 3X Crazy. Pacific Seed Bank said the strain has 21% THC, low CBD, and an herbal, sweet, peppery flavor profile.\r\n\r\n3X Crazy is an indica-leaning hybrid that does best with an experienced grower.

These strains combined to form 9lb Hammer\u2019s intoxicatingly fruity blend of grape flavors and autumn-colored foliage. 9lb Hammer was so named because it allegedly felt like a heavy hammer knocking users out cold. \r\n\r\nAccording to Jinxproof, 9lb Hammer packs a heavy sedative punch, due to large myrcene content and higher tested percentages of THC. ", "6": "Little information exists online regarding the magical-sounding Abracadabra \u2014 it seems to have materialized from thin air. While the strain's breeder and genetics are unknown, online sources confirm Abracadabra's earthy, citrus flavors and balanced mental and physical effects.", "7": "Abusive OG, or simply Abusive, was created or discovered by the breeders at Devil\u2019s Harvest Krew sometime in the early 2000s. The cultivar is said to be bred from a rare cut of OG Kush, also called LA Kush for the city where it was created. Its genetic origins, however, are mostly unknown. Contrary to its name, consumers report that Abusive OG produces tranquil euphoria delivered with a fragrant, pine-smelling aroma.\r\n\r\nNew and experienced growers alike will have an easy time cultivating Abusive OG, which has a reputation for low yields. Abusive OG flourishes with Screen of Green (SCROG) methods and grows into a short, squat plant when it reaches full maturity in 60-70 days. Once bloomed, the cultivar showcases tight, compact nugs covered in trichomes and orange pistils.", "8": "While its exact genetics remain a mystery, Acapulco Gold is a popular and historically significant sativa-leaning hybrid that thrives in outdoor grow environments and is indigenous to Acapulco, Mexico. As indoor cultivation becomes the go-to method for many growers, the original Acapulco Gold cultivar is considered to be a bit of a rarity within modern-day cannabis cultivation circles. \r\n\r\nKnown to produce an energetic and cerebral high, a true Acapulco Gold plant is distinguishable by its sativa growth traits, yielding chunky colas that range from dark green to golden brown in color. Carrying an aroma that has been described as burnt toffee, Acapulco Gold is reported to produce an earthy, pungent taste upon consumption. \r\n\r\nAlthough the strain is best suited for outdoor growing conditions, cultivators should have less difficulty with the newer generation of Acapulco Gold seeds. Following a 60-to-70-day flowering period, one Acapulco Gold strain is reported to yield up to 500 grams per square meter indoors and, if properly harvested outdoors in the Northern Hemisphere by mid-October, up to 1 1/2 kilograms per plant.", "9": "ACDC is a phenotype of the high-CBD strain Cannatonic (also known as the CBD Queen) that was selected by Dr. William Courtney after receiving a packet of seeds from its original breeder, Spain-based Resin Seeds. \r\n\r\nThe resulting ACDC, which is only available on the market as a clone, is exceptionally high in CBD, with a 20:1 CBD-to-THC ratio, according to testing from SC Labs. Resin Seeds describes the plant\u2019s aroma as a mix of cherry, diesel, gas, and Mandarin peel. Myrcene is a dominant terpene in ACDC.\r\n\r\nACDC is a parent to several CBD-rich hybrids. Sin City Seeds offers four ACDC hybrids with varying CBD-to-THC ratios \u2014 Thunderstruck (an S1 hybrid of ACDC and ACDC), Treasure Island (Swiss Gold and ACDC), HarleSin (ACDC and Harlequin), and Incredible Power (OmRita, BluePower, and ACDC). \r\n\r\nOther notable hybrids include TOCI (ACDC and Xena), EMT (ACDC and Canna-Tsu) from Med Tree Seeds, Valhalla (ACDC and Sky Dragon) from Love Genetics, and CBD Rich Blessing from Bodhi Seeds. A hybrid of ACDC and a CBD-rich Good Medicine male, CBD Rich Blessing has, in turn, been used by its breeder to cultivate several other CBD-rich hybrids.\r\n\r\nThe strain reportedly grows to average height, producing thin leaves and medium yields of big, dewy buds. The strain grows best indoors and in warm environments. It\u2019s reported to flower in 63-70 days, possibly longer in colder areas. ACDC can be finicky, so novice and intermediate growers with limited grow space may want to look elsewhere for a high-CBD plant. \r\n\r\nThe ACDC clone typically produces short, bushy plants with thin leaves that tend to grow about four feet tall. An ACDC clone Harborside submitted for genetic testing by Phylos Bioscience showed moderate levels of genetic variation.", "10": "A-Dub is said to be a potent strain with the legendary genetics of Sour Double, which is a cross of Sour Diesel and Sour Bubble, and Alien Dawg, a combination of Alien Technology and Chemdawg. According to several online sources, A-Dub has pale green buds covered with iconic red-orange hairs and glittery trichomes. It has a fruity, woody, spicy taste and strong sweet, earthy, sour aroma.\r\n\r\nGrowing notes online suggest that A-Dub grows easily inside or out, delivering high yields during an  eight-to-nine week flowering cycle. In 2014, High Times magazine named A-Dub the second-strongest strain on Earth, perhaps making it best left to experienced consumers.", "11": "These landrace strains are thought to originate in the Mazar-i-Sharif region of Afghanistan.

The cultivar grew in the wild for centuries and stabilized its genetic profile through continual natural selection. Considered by many breeders to be the backbone of today\u2019s modern Indica strains, Afghan Kush is known for its sour aroma and reported relaxing, euphoric effects.\r\n\r\nBreeders can grow Afghan Kush both indoors and outdoors, with a flowering period of 50-to-60 days, or in mid-October, depending on its environment. The plant grows short and stout, developing large, compact, dark-green buds. Highly resistant to most diseases and pests, Afghan Kush is known and loved for its plentiful yield.", "13": "Afghan Skunk, also known as Afghani Skunk, is an indica-leaning hybrid first crossed between an Afghan and Skunk #1 by the breeder Expert Seeds. Originally bred in the United States, the Afghan Skunk strain was relocated to the Netherlands in the 1980s to escape prohibition. \r\n\r\nThe creators of Afghan Skunk describe the strain as having a spicy aroma and sweet, fruity taste. According to Expert Seeds, the effects of this strain border between relaxing indica-like effects and a heady sativa high that stems from its Skunk lineage. THC levels for Afghan Skunk typically average about 18%. \r\n\r\nAfghan Skunk is said to be a vigorous grower, but also relatively easy to control and maintain healthy vegetation. Following a 55-day flowering cycle, indoor Afghan Skunk can yield between 500 to 550 grams per square meter, while when grown outdoors it is harvested in September in the Northern Hemisphere and can produce an impressive 900 grams to 1 kilogram, or about 2 pounds, per plant. ", "14": "Afgooey, or Afgoo, is an infamous cultivar that goes by a whole host of similar names.

", "18": "Alaskan Thunder Fuck (ATF) was originally cultivated in Matanuska Valley, Alaska. Sources are conflicted about the genetic origin of this strain, but most seem to agree it began as a cross between Russian Ruderalls and an unknown type of Northern California Sativa, later to be crossed again with Afghani Landrace in the 1970s. \r\n\r\nThe initial nose scent of this strain may be off-putting to some as its terpene profile is fairly unique. Mixing sweet fruitiness (banana and orange) with an earthy skunk (pine, diesel), this is a strain more suitable for a developed palate. Fans of Jack Herrer may enjoy the classic fresh lemony-pine notes of ATF.  \r\n\r\nBecause of its creativity-inducing effects, ATF is a great strain for those who wish to consume while still being able to concentrate. Too, many say this strain lacks the typical crash that comes with a potent sativa. Since ATF is known for its intensely cerebral head high, those prone to sensitivity may want to take a conservative first puff or two and see how it affects them. \r\n\r\nFun fact: this strain shares the name of a popular drag queen known for her high-energy performances.", "19": "Alien Cookies is a cross between Aliendawg and GSC (formerly Girl Scout Cookies), reportedly originated by the cannabis breeder Jaws Genetics. Although this Alien Cookies cultivar doesn\u2019t appear to be readily available in seed or clone form, the strain is said to have a pungent, earthy, sweet vanilla flavor profile and heavy trichome production. Twisty Treat Seeds also made an Alien Cookies with different genetics than the Jaws Genetics version, but they also seem to have discontinued that strain.\r\n\r\nThe balanced hybrid from Jaws is reportedly moderately difficult to grow, as these tall and lanky plants typically require support, according to online sources. The flowering time for this high-yielderis said to happen around eight to nine weeks.", "20": "Alien Dawg is a cross of Chemdawg and Alien Technology created by team at The Cali Connection.

Some say it\u2019s a creation of Alien Genetics.
